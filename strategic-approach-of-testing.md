## **2. Regression Testing** 🔄  
📌 **Purpose:** Ensures that new code changes do not break existing functionality.  
📌 **When:** After bug fixes, enhancements, or updates.  
📌 **Methods:**  
- **Retest all:** Executes all test cases.  
- **Selective Testing:** Runs only impacted test cases.  
- **Automated Regression Testing:** Uses tools like Selenium or Cypress for efficiency.
