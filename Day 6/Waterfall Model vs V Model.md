| Feature            | **Waterfall Model**                           | **V-Model (Verification & Validation Model)**  |
|--------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Definition**     | A linear sequential model where each phase must be completed before the next begins. | A modified Waterfall model where testing occurs in parallel with development. |
| **Approach**       | Sequential (one phase after another).  | Parallel (each development phase has a corresponding testing phase). |
| **Testing Phase**  | Testing happens after development is complete. | Testing is integrated with each development phase. |
| **Flexibility**    | Rigid, difficult to make changes once a phase is completed. | More flexible due to early defect detection. |
| **Risk Handling**  | High risk, as defects are found late in the cycle. | Lower risk, as testing starts early and defects are caught sooner. |
| **Cost of Fixing Bugs** | High, since bugs are found late in development. | Lower, as issues are identified in early stages. |
| **Best Used For**  | Small, simple projects with well-defined requirements. | Projects with clear requirements where early testing is beneficial. |
