The **V-Model (Verification and Validation Model)** is a **software development model** where testing happens **in parallel** with development. It emphasizes **early defect detection** by aligning **each development phase with a corresponding testing phase**.  

### 🔹 **Phases of V-Model**  

#### **1️⃣ Verification (Development Phases)**  
✔ **Requirement Analysis** → System test plan is created.  
✔ **System Design** → Acceptance test plan is prepared.  
✔ **Architectural Design** → Integration test plan is made.  
✔ **Module Design** → Unit test cases are written.  
✔ **Coding** → Development happens based on designs.  

#### **2️⃣ Validation (Testing Phases)**  
✔ **Unit Testing** → Tests individual components.  
✔ **Integration Testing** → Verifies module interactions.  
✔ **System Testing** → Checks overall system functionality.  
✔ **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)** → Ensures software meets business needs.  

### 🔹 **Key Features of V-Model**  
✅ Testing starts **early**, reducing defect costs.  
✅ Follows a **parallel** development and testing approach.  
✅ Suitable for **projects with well-defined requirements**.  
✅ Less flexible for requirement changes compared to Agile.
