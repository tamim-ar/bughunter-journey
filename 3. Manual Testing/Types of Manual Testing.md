## 🛠️ What Is Manual Testing?

**Manual Testing** is the process of manually executing test cases without using any automation tools or scripts. Testers act as end users, interacting with the application’s UI, functionality, and workflows to identify defects.

### 🔍 Key Characteristics

- **Human-driven**: Testers follow predefined test cases step by step.
- **Exploratory**: Allows intuitive discovery of issues through ad‑hoc and exploratory techniques.
- **No scripting**: Relies on human observation, not on automated scripts or test frameworks.
- **Flexible**: Easily adapts to small changes in requirements or UI without rewriting code.

### 🔁 Manual Testing Process

1. **Requirement Analysis**  
   Understand functional and non‑functional requirements to identify what needs testing.

2. **Test Planning**  
   Define scope, objectives, resources, and schedule for manual test activities.

3. **Test Case Design**  
   Write clear, detailed test cases with:  
   - Preconditions  
   - Input data  
   - Execution steps  
   - Expected results

4. **Test Environment Setup**  
   Prepare the hardware, software, network, and database configurations.

5. **Test Execution**  
   Manually run each test case, observe actual behavior, and compare it against expected results.

6. **Defect Reporting**  
   Log any deviations as defects in a bug‑tracking tool, attaching steps to reproduce and screenshots.

7. **Retesting & Regression**  
   Once defects are fixed, retest to confirm the fix and perform regression testing on impacted areas.

8. **Test Closure**  
   Summarize test activities, report coverage and defects, and provide recommendations.

### 🔧 Techniques in Manual Testing

- **Smoke Testing** – Quick check of core functionality after a build.  
- **Sanity Testing** – Focused validation of specific bug fixes or features.  
- **Exploratory Testing** – Ad‑hoc testing guided by tester experience.  
- **Usability Testing** – Assess ease of use and user experience.  
- **Ad‑Hoc Testing** – Unstructured, creative testing without formal test cases.

### ✅ Pros & Cons

| **Pros**                                          | **Cons**                                           |
|---------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| ✔ Intuitive, uncovers UX and workflow issues      | ✖ Time‑consuming for large or repetitive test suites |
| ✔ No need for automation tools or scripting skills | ✖ Prone to human error and inconsistency           |
| ✔ Quick to start for small or evolving features   | ✖ Difficult to scale and maintain over time        |

### 📈 When to Use Manual Testing

- **Early stages** where requirements are volatile  
- **Usability and UX reviews** requiring human judgment  
- **Ad‑hoc or exploratory scenarios** without clear requirements  
- **Short‑lived projects** where automation setup overhead isn’t justified

Manual testing remains a foundational QA practice, ensuring that human insight complements automated checks to deliver a robust, user‑friendly product.
