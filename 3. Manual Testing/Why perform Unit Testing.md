### ✅ Why Perform Unit Testing?

**Unit Testing** is crucial in software development because it helps ensure each part of your application works correctly in isolation before being integrated with other parts.

### 🔍 Key Reasons to Perform Unit Testing:

#### 1. **Early Bug Detection**
- Identifies issues at the very beginning of the development cycle.
- Saves time and cost by reducing bugs in later stages.

#### 2. **Improved Code Quality**
- Encourages developers to write **clean**, **modular**, and **reusable** code.
- Makes code easier to understand and maintain.

#### 3. **Facilitates Refactoring**
- When making changes to code, unit tests act as safety nets.
- Ensures new updates don't break existing functionality.

#### 4. **Simplifies Debugging**
- Helps quickly pinpoint where something broke.
- Each unit is tested independently, so errors are easier to trace.

#### 5. **Supports Agile and CI/CD**
- Frequent testing is essential in agile methodologies and continuous integration.
- Automated unit tests improve deployment speed and confidence.

#### 6. **Documentation for Developers**
- Unit tests show how functions and modules are intended to be used.
- Acts as **living documentation** for the codebase.

> **Summary:** Performing unit testing is a proactive approach to develop reliable and robust software. It saves time, reduces bugs, and ensures that every piece of your application does exactly what it’s supposed to do.
