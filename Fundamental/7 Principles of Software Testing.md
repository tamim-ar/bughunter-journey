Here’s a brief explanation of each principle:  

1️⃣ **Exhaustive Testing is Not Possible** – Testing everything is impractical; instead, risk-based and priority-driven testing is used.  

2️⃣ **Defect Clustering** – A small number of modules typically contain the majority of defects.  

3️⃣ **Pesticide Paradox** – Repeating the same test cases will eventually stop finding new bugs, so tests must be updated regularly.  

4️⃣ **Testing Shows Presence of Defects** – Testing can confirm the existence of bugs, but it cannot guarantee their absence.  

5️⃣ **Absence of Error – Fallacy** – A defect-free system can still fail if it does not meet user requirements.  

6️⃣ **Early Testing** – Testing should start as early as possible in the development cycle to reduce cost and effort.  

7️⃣ **Testing is Context-Dependent** – Testing approaches vary based on the application type (e.g., banking vs. gaming software).
