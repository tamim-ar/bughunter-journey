## **Types of Software**

Software is a collection of instructions that tell a computer how to work. It can be broadly classified into the following categories:

---

### 1. **System Software**
**Definition:**  
System software acts as a bridge between the user and the computer hardware. It manages the hardware and provides a platform for other software to run.

**Functions:**
- Controls hardware components
- Manages system resources
- Enables the functioning of application software

**Examples:**
- Operating Systems: Windows, macOS, Linux
- Utility Programs: Disk Cleanup, Antivirus
- Device Drivers: Printer driver, Graphics driver
- Firmware: Embedded software in ROM

---

### 2. **Application Software**
**Definition:**  
Application software is designed to perform specific tasks for the user. It runs on top of system software and helps users complete activities like writing documents or browsing the internet.

**Functions:**
- Solves real-world problems
- Provides productivity tools
- Enhances user interaction with the system

**Examples:**
- Word Processors: Microsoft Word, Google Docs
- Browsers: Chrome, Firefox
- Media Players: VLC, Windows Media Player
- Games: FIFA, PUBG

### 3. **Programming Software**
**Definition:**  
Programming software provides tools to programmers for writing, testing, and maintaining code.

**Functions:**
- Enables software development
- Converts human-readable code into machine code
- Debugs and maintains code

**Examples:**
- Text Editors: VS Code, Notepad++
- Compilers: GCC, Java Compiler
- Debuggers: GDB
- Interpreters: Python Interpreter

### 4. **Middleware**
**Definition:**  
Middleware is software that connects different applications or services. It enables communication between separate systems or layers in an application.

**Functions:**
- Facilitates data transfer between applications
- Manages distributed systems
- Supports application integration

**Examples:**
- Database Middleware: ODBC, JDBC
- Message-Oriented Middleware: RabbitMQ, Apache Kafka

### 5. **Driver Software**
**Definition:**  
Driver software controls and manages the operation of a particular hardware device. It acts as a translator between the hardware and the operating system.

**Functions:**
- Ensures proper hardware functionality
- Converts OS instructions into device-specific commands

**Examples:**
- Audio Drivers
- Graphics Card Drivers
- Network Adapter Drivers
