## ðŸ“š **What is Software Testing?**

Software Testing is an integral part of software development aimed at ensuring the functionality, security, and quality of a software product. Testing helps identify defects and ensures that the software meets the required standards.

### **Key Objectives of Software Testing**  
- **Ensure Functionality**: Verify that the software works as expected and fulfills user requirements.
- **Identify Defects**: Detect bugs early in the development cycle to prevent costly fixes in later stages.
- **Improve Quality**: Improve the software's reliability, stability, and usability, reducing risks in the production environment.
- **Ensure Compliance**: Validate that the software complies with industry standards and regulatory requirements.

### **Why is Software Testing Important?**

Software testing plays a vital role in identifying issues before a product reaches users. Here are some key reasons for testing software:

- **Improves Product Quality**: Testing ensures the software meets the specified requirements, is bug-free, and functions correctly.
- **Reduces Cost**: Identifying and fixing defects early in development reduces the cost of fixing defects after deployment.
- **Ensures Security**: Security testing helps detect vulnerabilities, preventing security breaches and protecting sensitive data.
- **Enhances User Experience**: Usability testing ensures the product is intuitive and user-friendly.

### **Software Testing Lifecycle (STLC)**  
The **Software Testing Lifecycle** (STLC) includes the following phases:
1. **Requirement Analysis**: Identifying testing requirements based on the project specifications.
2. **Test Planning**: Creating a test plan that outlines the testing strategy, resources, and schedule.
3. **Test Design**: Writing test cases and preparing test data.
4. **Test Execution**: Running the tests and recording the results.
5. **Defect Reporting**: Documenting and tracking defects.
6. **Test Closure**: Wrapping up the testing process and creating a final report.
