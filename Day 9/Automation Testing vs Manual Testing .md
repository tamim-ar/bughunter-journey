| Parameter                | Automation Testing                                                                 | Manual Testing                                                                                       |

| Definition               | Automation Testing uses automation tools to execute test cases.                    | In manual testing, test cases are executed by a human tester and software.                           |
| Processing time          | Automated testing is significantly faster than a manual approach.                  | Manual testing is time-consuming and takes up human resources.                                       |
| Exploratory Testing      | Automation does not allow random testing                                           | Exploratory testing is possible in Manual Testing                                                    |
| Initial investment       | The initial investment in the automated testing is higher. Though the ROI is better in the long run. | The initial investment in the Manual testing is comparatively lower. ROI is lower compared to Automation testing in the long run. |
| Reliability              | Automated testing is a reliable method, as it is performed by tools and scripts. There is no testing Fatigue. | Manual testing is not as accurate because of the possibility of the human errors.                    |
| UI Change                | For even a trivial change in the UI of the AUT, Automated Test Scripts need to be modified to work as expected | Small changes like change in id, class, etc. of a button wouldnâ€™t thwart execution of a manual tester. |
| Investment               | Investment is required for testing tools as well as automation engineers           | Investment is needed for human resources.                                                            |
| Cost-effective           | Not cost effective for low volume regression                                       | Not cost effective for high volume regression.                                                       |
| Test Report Visibility   | With automation testing, all stakeholders can login into the automation system and check test execution results | Manual Tests are usually recorded in an Excel or Word, and test results are not readily/ readily available. |
| Human observation        | Automated testing does not involve human consideration. So it can never give assurance of user-friendliness and positive customer experience. | The manual testing method allows human observation, which may be useful to offer user-friendly system. |
| Performance Testing      | Performance Tests like Load Testing, Stress Testing, Spike Testing, etc. have to be tested by an automation tool compulsorily. | Performance Testing is not feasible manually                                                         |
| Parallel Execution       | This testing can be executed on different operating platforms in parallel and reduce test execution time. | Manual tests can be executed in parallel but would need to increase your human resource which is expensive |
| Batch testing            | You can Batch multiple Test Scripts for nightly execution.                         | Manual tests cannot be batched.                                                                      |
| Programming knowledge    | Programming knowledge is a must in automation testing.                             | No need for programming in Manual Testing.                                                           |
| Set up                   | Automation test requires less complex test execution set up.                       | Manual testing needs have a more straightforward test execution setup                                |
| Engagement               | Done by tools. Its accurate and never gets bored!                                  | Repetitive Manual Test Execution can get boring and error-prone.                                     |
| Ideal approach           | Automation testing is useful when frequently executing the same set of test cases  | Manual testing proves useful when the test case only needs to run once or twice.                     |
| Build Verification Testing | Automation testing is useful for Build Verification Testing (BVT).                | Executing the Build Verification Testing (BVT) is very difficult and time-consuming in manual testing. |
| Deadlines                | Automated Tests have zero risks of missing out a pre-decided test.                 | Manual Testing has a higher risk of missing out the pre-decided test deadline.                       |
| Framework                | Automation testing uses frameworks like Data Drive, Keyword, Hybrid to accelerate the automation process. | Manual Testing does not use frameworks but may use guidelines, checklists, stringent processes to draft certain test cases. |
| Documentation            | Automated Tests acts as a document provides training value especially for automated unit test cases. A new developer can look into a unit test cases and understand the code base quickly. | Manual Test cases provide no training value                                                          |
| Test Design              | Automated Unit Tests enforce/drive Test Driven Development Design.                 | Manual Unit Tests do not drive design into the coding process                                        |
| Devops                   | Automated Tests help in Build Verification Testing and are an integral part of DevOps Cycle | Manual Testing defeats the automated build principle of DevOps                                       |
| When to Use?             | Automated Testing is suited for Regression Testing, Performance Testing, Load Testing or highly repeatable functional test cases. | Manual Testing is suitable for Exploratory, Usability and Adhoc Testing. It should also be used where the AUT changes frequently. |
