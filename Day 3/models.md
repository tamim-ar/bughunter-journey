### **Software Testing Models**  

Software testing models define the approach and process followed in software testing. These models help in structuring testing activities efficiently.  

---

## **1. Waterfall Model**  
ðŸ“Œ **Description:** A linear, step-by-step approach where each phase must be completed before moving to the next.  
ðŸ“Œ **Phases:**  
- Requirement Analysis â†’ Design â†’ Development â†’ Testing â†’ Deployment â†’ Maintenance  
ðŸ“Œ **Best For:** Small projects with well-defined requirements.  
ðŸ“Œ **Drawback:** Late testing phase leads to high defect fixing costs.  

---

## **2. V-Model (Verification & Validation Model)**  
ðŸ“Œ **Description:** Testing happens in parallel with development, ensuring early defect detection.  
ðŸ“Œ **Phases:**  
- Requirement Analysis â‡” Acceptance Testing  
- System Design â‡” System Testing  
- Module Design â‡” Integration Testing  
- Coding â‡” Unit Testing  
ðŸ“Œ **Best For:** Projects with clear requirements needing early testing.  
ðŸ“Œ **Drawback:** Rigid structure, not suitable for dynamic changes.  

---

## **3. Agile Model**  
ðŸ“Œ **Description:** An iterative and incremental model where software is developed and tested in small cycles (sprints).  
ðŸ“Œ **Phases:**  
- Planning â†’ Design â†’ Development â†’ Testing â†’ Review (repeats in each sprint)  
ðŸ“Œ **Best For:** Fast-changing requirements and continuous delivery.  
ðŸ“Œ **Drawback:** Requires strong communication and frequent collaboration.  

---

## **4. Spiral Model**  
ðŸ“Œ **Description:** A risk-driven model combining iterative and Waterfall approaches.  
ðŸ“Œ **Phases:**  
1. Planning  
2. Risk Analysis  
3. Development & Testing  
4. Evaluation  
ðŸ“Œ **Best For:** Large projects with high risk and complex requirements.  
ðŸ“Œ **Drawback:** Expensive and requires high expertise in risk assessment.  

---

## **5. Iterative Model**  
ðŸ“Œ **Description:** Software is developed in cycles, improving with each iteration.  
ðŸ“Œ **Phases:**  
1. Requirement gathering  
2. Development  
3. Testing  
4. Feedback & Improvement (repeat)  
ðŸ“Œ **Best For:** Projects needing continuous enhancements.  
ðŸ“Œ **Drawback:** Can become costly and time-consuming.  

---

## **6. Big Bang Model**  
ðŸ“Œ **Description:** No formal process, all development happens at once, and testing is done later.  
ðŸ“Œ **Best For:** Small projects with undefined requirements.  
ðŸ“Œ **Drawback:** High risk of failure due to lack of structure.
