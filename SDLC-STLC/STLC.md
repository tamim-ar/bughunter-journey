## üß™ **Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC)**

The **Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC)** is a sequence of activities conducted to perform software testing in a structured and systematic way. Each phase has specific goals, tasks, and deliverables that ensure the quality of the product before it goes live.

---

### üîÅ **Phases of STLC**

---

### **1. Requirement Analysis**

- **Goal:** Understand what needs to be tested.
- **Activities:**
  - Analyze software requirement documents (SRS, BRS).
  - Identify testable and non-testable requirements.
  - Involve business analysts, developers, and stakeholders.
- **Output:** **Requirement Traceability Matrix (RTM)**, automation feasibility report.

---

### **2. Test Planning**

- **Goal:** Define the testing strategy and plan.
- **Activities:**
  - Identify scope, objectives, tools, and resources.
  - Estimate effort and define timelines.
  - Assign roles and responsibilities.
- **Output:** **Test Plan**, **Effort Estimation**, **Risk Mitigation Plan**.

---

### **3. Test Case Design**

- **Goal:** Prepare test cases and test data.
- **Activities:**
  - Write detailed test cases and test scenarios.
  - Define input data, expected results, and preconditions.
  - Review and get approval of test cases.
- **Output:** **Test Cases**, **Test Scripts**, **Test Data**.

---

### **4. Test Environment Setup**

- **Goal:** Prepare the test environment and tools.
- **Activities:**
  - Set up software and hardware for testing.
  - Configure servers, databases, and network.
  - Verify environment readiness using smoke testing.
- **Output:** **Test Environment**, **Readiness Report**.

---

### **5. Test Execution**

- **Goal:** Run the test cases and report issues.
- **Activities:**
  - Execute manual or automated tests.
  - Compare actual and expected results.
  - Report defects and track them to closure.
- **Output:** **Test Execution Report**, **Bug Reports**, **Screenshots/Logs**.

---

### **6. Test Cycle Closure**

- **Goal:** Complete testing activities and evaluate results.
- **Activities:**
  - Ensure all test cases are executed.
  - Analyze defect trends and test coverage.
  - Prepare test summary and lessons learned.
- **Output:** **Test Summary Report**, **Metrics**, **Closure Document**.

## ‚úÖ **Benefits of STLC**

- Ensures complete test coverage.
- Enhances product quality.
- Detects bugs early in the cycle.
- Supports structured test documentation.

## üìö **STLC vs SDLC**

| Aspect             | SDLC                                     | STLC                                  |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Focus              | Overall software development              | Testing of the software                |
| Involves           | Developers, project managers, etc.        | Testers, QA analysts                   |
| Deliverable        | Working software                         | Quality-assured software               |
| Starts with        | Requirement collection                    | Test requirement analysis              |
| Ends with          | Maintenance                               | Test closure                           |
