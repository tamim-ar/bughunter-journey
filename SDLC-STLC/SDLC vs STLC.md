SDLC: SDLC is Software Development Life Cycle. It is the sequence of activities carried out by Developers to design and develop high-quality software.

STLC: STLC is Software Testing Life Cycle. It consists of a series of activities carried out by Testers methodologically to test your software product.

Waterfall Model: Waterfall model is a sequential model divided into different phases of software development activity. Each stage is designed for performing the specific activity. Testing phase in waterfall model starts only after implementation of the system is done.

| Feature              | **SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)**   | **STLC (Software Testing Life Cycle)**  |
|----------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Definition**       | Process of developing software from planning to deployment. | Process of testing the software to ensure quality. |
| **Focus**           | Development of the software.  | Verification and validation of the software. |
| **Phases**          | Planning, Requirement Analysis, Design, Development, Testing, Deployment, Maintenance. | Requirement Analysis, Test Planning, Test Case Design, Test Environment Setup, Test Execution, Test Closure. |
| **Participants**    | Developers, Business Analysts, Project Managers, Designers, Testers. | Testers, QA Engineers, Developers (for fixing bugs). |
| **Output**         | A fully developed software product. | Test reports, defect logs, and quality assurance reports. |
| **Goal**            | Build a functional product that meets requirements. | Ensure the product is defect-free and meets quality standards. |
| **Dependency**      | SDLC includes STLC as a phase (Testing). | STLC is a subset of SDLC and runs parallel to it. |
