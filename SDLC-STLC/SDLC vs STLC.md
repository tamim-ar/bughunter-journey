| **Aspect**                 | **SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)**                          | **STLC (Software Testing Life Cycle)**                         |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**             | Process of developing software through defined phases                | Process of testing software to ensure it meets requirements     |
| **Primary Focus**          | Development of the application/product                               | Verification and validation of the application/product          |
| **Participants**           | Business Analysts, Developers, Project Managers                     | QA Engineers, Testers, Test Managers                            |
| **Start Point**            | Starts with requirement gathering                                   | Starts with requirement analysis for testing                    |
| **End Point**              | Ends with deployment and maintenance                                | Ends with test cycle closure after testing is complete          |
| **Purpose**                | To build a functional software product                              | To ensure the product is defect-free and meets user expectations|
| **Activities Involved**    | Planning, designing, coding, testing, deployment, maintenance       | Requirement analysis, test planning, test design, execution, closure |
| **Deliverables**           | SRS, Design Docs, Source Code, Deployment Guide                     | Test Plan, Test Cases, Bug Reports, Test Summary                |
| **Requirement Analysis**   | For development needs                                               | For identifying what needs to be tested                         |
| **Outcome**                | A working software product                                           | A quality-assured and validated product                         |
