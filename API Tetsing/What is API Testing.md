### 🧪 What is API Testing?

**API Testing** is a type of software testing that focuses on verifying whether an API works as expected. Instead of testing the UI, it tests the **request and response** of the API directly.

### 🔍 Key Goals:
- Check if the **API returns correct responses**
- Verify **data integrity, status codes, and error messages**
- Ensure the API handles **invalid inputs and edge cases**

---

### ✅ What It Covers:
- **Functionality** – Does the API do what it's supposed to?
- **Performance** – Is it fast and responsive?
- **Security** – Is it protected from unauthorized access?
- **Reliability** – Does it behave correctly in different situations?
