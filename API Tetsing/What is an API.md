# 🔗 What is an API?

An **API (Application Programming Interface)** allows two software applications to talk to each other by following a set of defined rules.

## 📷 Visual Analogy

🧑‍💻 You (App)  
⬇️ Request  
👨‍🍳 Waiter (API)  
⬇️  
🏠 Kitchen (Server/Service)  
⬆️  
👨‍🍳 Waiter (API)  
⬆️ Response  
🧑‍💻 You (App)

The API takes your request, sends it to the system, and returns a result—just like a waiter in a restaurant.

## ✅ Why APIs Matter

- Enable **communication** between apps
- Help **integrate** services
- Used in web, mobile, desktop, and IoT apps

## 🧪 Example

A **weather app** sends a request to a weather API → receives weather data → shows it to the user.
