## 🚦 **Priority in Software Testing**

**Priority** defines the **urgency** of fixing a defect. It reflects how soon the issue should be **resolved and delivered**, considering the **business impact and deadlines**.

Priority is usually determined by the **Project Manager, Business Analyst, or Developer Lead**—not the tester.
