## üîç **Types of Software Testing**

Software testing can be categorized based on the purpose of the test, the level at which it‚Äôs conducted, and the methodology employed. Below is an expanded breakdown of the different types:

---

### **1. Manual Testing**  
Manual testing involves a tester manually performing the test cases without using any automated tools. This type of testing is effective for exploratory testing, ad-hoc testing, and usability testing. It‚Äôs essential for understanding the user experience and ensuring that the application meets the expected behavior under various conditions.  

---

### **2. Automated Testing**  
Automated testing uses testing tools (e.g., Selenium, TestNG) to automatically execute predefined test cases. It is highly effective for repetitive tests such as regression testing. Automated tests are faster than manual testing and can be run frequently to ensure that no new defects are introduced during development. It‚Äôs essential for large-scale software or when testing needs to be repeated across different environments.

### **3. Functional Testing**  
Functional testing checks the software‚Äôs functionality against the requirements and ensures that the software behaves as expected. It typically includes:
- **Unit Testing**: Tests individual components of the software to ensure they work in isolation.
- **Integration Testing**: Tests the interaction between different components to ensure they work together.
- **System Testing**: Tests the complete system as a whole to ensure that all components integrate and work seamlessly.
- **Acceptance Testing**: Verifies whether the system meets business requirements and is ready for deployment.

---

### **4. Non-Functional Testing**  
Non-functional testing assesses the software's attributes such as performance, scalability, security, and usability. Some examples are:
- **Performance Testing**: Ensures that the system performs well under expected and peak loads.
- **Security Testing**: Tests the system for vulnerabilities, threats, and risks to sensitive data.
- **Usability Testing**: Assesses the user interface and user experience to ensure the application is intuitive and easy to use.
- **Compatibility Testing**: Verifies that the software works across different devices, operating systems, and browsers.

### **5. Manual vs. Automated Testing**  
Manual testing is ideal for scenarios that require human judgment, such as UI/UX testing or exploratory testing. Automated testing is preferred for tasks that require repetition, accuracy, and speed, such as regression tests or performance tests. Both types complement each other in ensuring comprehensive test coverage.

---

### **6. White-box Testing**  
White-box testing (also known as structural testing) involves testing the internal structure of an application. It requires knowledge of the code and its logic, and testers use it to ensure that the code is well-structured, secure, and functioning as expected. Testers may conduct unit tests or code coverage analysis.  

---

### **7. Black-box Testing**  
Black-box testing focuses on the external behavior of the software and doesn't require knowledge of its internal workings. Testers examine the outputs in response to various inputs, ensuring the system functions as intended. This is typically done in functional testing, such as system testing or acceptance testing.  

---

### **8. Regression Testing**  
Regression testing ensures that new code changes do not introduce defects into existing features. It checks that the old functionality still works as expected after the introduction of new changes. Automated testing is typically used for regression testing due to its repetitive nature.

---

### **9. User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**  
UAT is typically conducted by the end-users or clients to verify that the software meets business requirements. UAT ensures that the software satisfies the user‚Äôs needs and expectations before it‚Äôs officially released into production.
