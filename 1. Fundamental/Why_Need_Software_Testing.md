## üßê **Why Do We Need Software Testing?**

Software testing is critical for ensuring that the software meets its intended goals and satisfies the user‚Äôs needs. Below are the reasons why software testing is a must in the development process:

---

### **1. Identifies Bugs Early**  
Testing helps identify defects early in the software development process, allowing developers to fix them before they become more complex and costly to resolve.

---

### **2. Validates Software Functionality**  
Testing ensures that the software behaves as expected, meets the requirements, and provides the desired user experience. If the software doesn‚Äôt meet functional expectations, it will not serve its intended purpose.

---

### **3. Enhances Performance**  
Testing helps uncover performance bottlenecks, ensuring that the software performs well under different loads, such as heavy traffic or intensive calculations.

---

### **4. Ensures Compliance with Standards**  
Testing ensures that the software complies with regulatory requirements and industry standards. This is essential for software that handles sensitive data or operates in regulated industries.

---

### **5. Protects Reputation**  
By

 ensuring software quality and security, testing helps prevent product failures that could damage a company‚Äôs reputation and erode customer trust.
