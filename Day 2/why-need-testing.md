### **Key Reasons for Software Testing**  

✅ **Detect and Fix Bugs Early**  
- Identifies defects before they reach production.  
- Saves time and cost compared to fixing bugs after release.  

✅ **Ensures Software Functionality**  
- Verifies that the software meets requirements and works as expected.  
- Prevents critical failures that could impact users.  

✅ **Enhances Security**  
- Finds vulnerabilities to prevent hacking and data breaches.  
- Ensures compliance with security standards.  

✅ **Improves Performance & Reliability**  
- Ensures software performs well under various conditions.  
- Identifies bottlenecks and optimizes speed.  

✅ **Ensures User Satisfaction**  
- Delivers a smooth, bug-free experience.  
- Improves usability and accessibility.  

✅ **Reduces Maintenance Costs**  
- Prevents future issues by ensuring stability.  
- Saves effort and money on post-release fixes.  

✅ **Compliance with Standards**  
- Ensures adherence to industry standards (ISO, GDPR, etc.).
