### **Software Testing**  

**Testing** is the process of evaluating a software application to detect and fix defects before deployment. It ensures that the software meets requirements, functions correctly, and is free of bugs.

## **Types of Testing**  

### **1. Functional Testing**  
Checks if the software functions as expected.  
✅ **Unit Testing** – Tests individual components or modules.  
✅ **Integration Testing** – Ensures different modules work together.  
✅ **System Testing** – Tests the entire application as a whole.  
✅ **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)** – Validates if the software meets business needs.  
✅ **Regression Testing** – Ensures new changes don’t break existing functionality.  
✅ **Sanity & Smoke Testing** – Quick checks to verify basic functionality.

### **2. Non-Functional Testing**  
Tests software performance, security, and reliability.  
✅ **Performance Testing** – Measures speed, scalability, and stability.  
✅ **Load Testing** – Checks how the software performs under heavy usage.  
✅ **Stress Testing** – Determines software behavior under extreme conditions.  
✅ **Security Testing** – Identifies vulnerabilities and security flaws.  
✅ **Usability Testing** – Assesses user-friendliness and ease of use.

### **3. Manual vs. Automated Testing**  
- **Manual Testing** – Testers execute test cases manually without tools.  
- **Automated Testing** – Uses tools like Selenium, JUnit, TestNG, Jest for faster and repeated testing.

### **Testing Life Cycle (STLC - Software Testing Life Cycle)**  
1. **Requirement Analysis** – Understand what needs to be tested.  
2. **Test Planning** – Define strategy, tools, and timeline.  
3. **Test Case Development** – Write test cases and scripts.  
4. **Test Environment Setup** – Configure hardware/software for testing.  
5. **Test Execution** – Run tests and report defects.  
6. **Test Closure** – Evaluate test results and document findings.
