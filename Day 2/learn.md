# SDLC - Software Development Life Cycle

**Software Development Life Cycle** is a structured process for developing software applications. It consists of the following phases:  

1. **Planning** – Define project scope, objectives, and feasibility.  
2. **Requirement Analysis** – Gather and document software requirements.  
3. **Design** – Create system architecture and UI/UX design.  
4. **Implementation (Coding)** – Develop the actual software.  
5. **Testing** – Identify and fix bugs through various testing methods.  
6. **Deployment** – Release the software for users.  
7. **Maintenance** – Provide updates, fixes, and improvements.

### **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) - In Depth**  

SDLC is a systematic process used to design, develop, test, and deploy high-quality software. It ensures that the software meets customer requirements and is delivered on time and within budget.  

---

## **1. Planning Phase**  
**Purpose:** Define project objectives, feasibility, and scope.  
**Key Activities:**  
- Business needs analysis  
- Feasibility study (Technical, Economic, Legal, Operational)  
- Resource allocation  
- Risk assessment  
- Budget and timeline estimation  

**Outcome:** Project charter, feasibility report, high-level requirements.  

---

## **2. Requirement Analysis Phase**  
**Purpose:** Gather and document functional and non-functional requirements.  
**Key Activities:**  
- Stakeholder meetings  
- Business Requirement Document (BRD) creation  
- Functional Requirement Specification (FRS)  
- Use case analysis  
- Requirement validation  

**Outcome:** SRS (Software Requirement Specification) document.  

---

## **3. Design Phase**  
**Purpose:** Create the system architecture and design the UI/UX.  
**Key Activities:**  
- **High-Level Design (HLD)** – System architecture, module breakdown, technology stack.  
- **Low-Level Design (LLD)** – Detailed design of components, database schema, API design.  
- UI/UX wireframes and prototypes  
- Security and performance considerations  

**Outcome:** Design specifications, wireframes, prototypes.  

---

## **4. Development (Implementation) Phase**  
**Purpose:** Convert design into actual code.  
**Key Activities:**  
- Coding using selected programming languages  
- Version control (Git, GitHub, GitLab)  
- Database integration  
- API development  
- Unit testing by developers  

**Outcome:** Source code, compiled software, unit test reports.  

---

## **5. Testing Phase**  
**Purpose:** Identify and fix bugs, ensure functionality and security.  
**Key Activities:**  
- **Unit Testing** – Verify individual components.  
- **Integration Testing** – Ensure smooth communication between modules.  
- **System Testing** – Validate the entire system.  
- **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)** – Verify software meets business needs.  
- **Performance & Security Testing** – Identify vulnerabilities and performance bottlenecks.  

**Outcome:** Test reports, defect reports, approved software for deployment.  

---

## **6. Deployment Phase**  
**Purpose:** Release the software for end-users.  
**Key Activities:**  
- Deploy on production servers  
- Configure cloud hosting, databases, and security settings  
- Monitor performance post-deployment  
- Provide user training and documentation  

**Outcome:** Live software accessible to users.  

---

## **7. Maintenance & Support Phase**  
**Purpose:** Ensure the software remains operational and updated.  
**Key Activities:**  
- Bug fixes and patch releases  
- Performance optimization  
- Adding new features as per user feedback  
- Security updates  

**Outcome:** Updated and stable software with continuous improvements.  

---

### **SDLC Models**  
There are several models used in SDLC:  
- **Waterfall Model** – Linear and sequential approach.  
- **Agile Model** – Iterative and flexible approach (Scrum, Kanban).  
- **V-Model (Verification & Validation)** – Testing is planned parallel to development.  
- **Iterative Model** – Develop in cycles, refining with each iteration.  
- **Spiral Model** – Risk-driven development, combining iterative and Waterfall.  
- **Big Bang Model** – No formal structure, best for small projects.

### **Key Benefits of SDLC**  
✅ Ensures systematic development.  
✅ Reduces project risks.  
✅ Improves software quality.  
✅ Enhances customer satisfaction.  
✅ Optimizes resource utilization.
