## 🛠️ **Severity in Software Testing**

**Severity** defines the **impact of a defect** on the application’s functionality. It indicates how **serious** the defect is and how much it **affects the system or user experience**.

Severity is determined by the **QA team or testers**, and it helps in assessing the technical **risk** of the defect.

### 🔹 **Types of Severity**

#### 1. **Blocker / Showstopper (Severity 1)**
- 🚫 The application or major feature is completely **unusable**.
- **No further testing** or operation can continue.
- **Example:** App crashes on startup; login fails entirely.

#### 2. **Critical (Severity 2)**
- 🔥 A core feature or function **fails completely**.
- **No workaround** exists.
- **Example:** Payment system doesn’t process transactions.

#### 3. **Major (Severity 3)**
- ⚠️ A significant feature behaves incorrectly.
- **Workaround is available**, but the issue needs fixing soon.
- **Example:** Upload feature works but the file preview breaks.

#### 4. **Minor (Severity 4)**
- 🐞 Defect is mostly **cosmetic or trivial**.
- Doesn’t affect core functionality.
- **Example:** Typos, font size mismatch, or button misalignment.
