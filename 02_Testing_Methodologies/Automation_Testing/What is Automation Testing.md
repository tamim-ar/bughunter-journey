## ü§ñ What is Automation Testing?

**Automation Testing** is a software testing technique that uses specialized tools and scripts to automatically execute test cases, compare actual outcomes with expected results, and report findings‚Äîwithout manual intervention.

### üß† Key Characteristics

- **Tool-driven**: Uses frameworks and tools (like Selenium, Cypress, JUnit, TestNG, etc.)
- **Script-based**: Involves writing test scripts in programming or scripting languages.
- **Faster execution**: Ideal for regression testing and repeated test cycles.
- **Reusable**: Scripts can be reused across different builds and test environments.

### üîÅ Automation Testing Process

1. **Test Tool Selection**  
   Choose the right automation tool based on the application type, technology stack, and team skills.

2. **Test Planning**  
   Define scope, objectives, resources, schedule, and ROI of automation.

3. **Test Case Identification**  
   Select test cases that are:
   - Repetitive
   - High-risk
   - Time-consuming
   - Stable and predictable

4. **Test Script Development**  
   Write scripts using programming/scripting languages and frameworks.

5. **Test Environment Setup**  
   Configure tools, data, and environments to support automated test execution.

6. **Test Execution**  
   Run automated test scripts using tools or CI/CD pipelines.

7. **Result Analysis & Reporting**  
   Automatically generate reports and logs. Analyze failures and identify issues.

8. **Test Maintenance**  
   Update scripts when application features or UI change.

### üìà When to Use Automation Testing

- **Regression testing** in stable builds  
- **Performance/load testing** with large data sets  
- **Smoke/sanity testing** in CI/CD pipelines  
- **Repetitive test cases** run frequently  
- **Cross-browser or cross-platform testing**
