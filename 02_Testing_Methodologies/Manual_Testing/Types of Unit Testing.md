# **Types of Unit Testing**

---

### ðŸ”¹ 1. **Manual Unit Testing**
- Developers manually check individual units or components of code.
- Suitable for small, simple modules.
- Time-consuming and prone to human error.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 2. **Automated Unit Testing**
- Uses frameworks/tools (e.g., JUnit, NUnit, pytest) to test units automatically.
- Fast, repeatable, and preferred for larger projects.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 3. **White Box Testing**
- Focuses on the internal logic, structure, and code flow.
- Developer writes tests based on knowledge of the code.
- Involves techniques like condition testing, loop testing, and path testing.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 4. **Black Box Testing**
- Focuses only on inputs and expected outputs, not internal code.
- Often used in integration with other components for I/O behavior validation.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 5. **Gray Box Testing**
- Combines both white box and black box testing strategies.
- Testers have partial knowledge of the internal workings.
