## **üåÄ Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)**

The **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** is a structured process used to develop high-quality software systematically. It defines all the steps involved in the development of a software application, from **initial planning** to **maintenance after deployment**.

---

### üîÅ **Phases of SDLC**

---

### **1. Requirement Gathering and Analysis**

- **Goal:** Understand and document what the client or end-user needs.
- **Activities:**
  - Conduct meetings with stakeholders.
  - Gather business, user, and system requirements.
  - Analyze feasibility: technical, operational, and financial.
- **Output:** **Software Requirements Specification (SRS)** document.

---

### **2. Planning**

- **Goal:** Strategize how the software will be built.
- **Activities:**
  - Estimate time, cost, and resources.
  - Create a project plan and schedule.
  - Define risks and mitigation strategies.
- **Output:** **Project Plan**, **Resource Allocation**, **Risk Management Plan**.

---

### **3. System Design**

- **Goal:** Convert the requirements into a blueprint for development.
- **Activities:**
  - High-Level Design (HLD): architecture, database, modules.
  - Low-Level Design (LLD): detailed logic, interface design, pseudocode.
- **Output:** **Design Document Specification (DDS)**.

---

### **4. Implementation (Development/Coding)**

- **Goal:** Build the actual software using the selected programming languages and tools.
- **Activities:**
  - Developers write code according to the design.
  - Follow coding guidelines and best practices.
  - Conduct unit testing to validate individual modules.
- **Output:** **Executable Code**, **Source Files**, **Code Repository**.

---

### **5. Testing**

- **Goal:** Identify and fix defects to ensure software quality.
- **Types of Testing:**
  - **Unit Testing** ‚Äì Test individual components.
  - **Integration Testing** ‚Äì Ensure modules work together.
  - **System Testing** ‚Äì Test the entire system.
  - **Acceptance Testing** ‚Äì Validate with client requirements.
- **Activities:**
  - Write and execute test cases.
  - Log and resolve bugs.
- **Output:** **Test Cases**, **Bug Reports**, **Test Summary Report**.

---

### **6. Deployment**

- **Goal:** Deliver the finished product to the user or client.
- **Activities:**
  - Release software to a live environment.
  - Perform setup and configuration.
  - Provide user training (if needed).
- **Types:**
  - Phased, Pilot, Big Bang, or Parallel Deployment.
- **Output:** **Live Software**, **Deployment Documentation**.

---

### **7. Maintenance**

- **Goal:** Keep the software running smoothly after deployment.
- **Types:**
  - **Corrective Maintenance** ‚Äì Fixing bugs.
  - **Adaptive Maintenance** ‚Äì Adapting to new environments.
  - **Perfective Maintenance** ‚Äì Enhancing performance or features.
- **Activities:**
  - Monitor system performance.
  - Apply updates and patches.
  - Handle user feedback and change requests.
- **Output:** **Updated Software**, **Maintenance Logs**.

## ‚úÖ **Benefits of SDLC**

- Provides a clear project roadmap.
- Improves software quality and reliability.
- Helps manage time, cost, and risk.
- Ensures user requirements are fulfilled.

## üìö **Common SDLC Models**

| Model           | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| **Waterfall**     | Sequential, easy to manage, but rigid. |
| **Agile**         | Iterative and incremental, supports rapid changes. |
| **V-Model**       | Validation and verification happen side-by-side. |
| **Spiral**        | Focuses on risk analysis and iterative improvement. |
| **Iterative**     | Builds the system in small parts repeatedly. |
| **Big Bang**      | No formal process, good for small projects. |
